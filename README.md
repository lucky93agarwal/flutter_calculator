# flutter_calculator
Flutter SDK is an open-source software development kit for building beautiful UI which is natively compiled. In this article we will build a Simple Calculator App that can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication or division depending upon the user input. Making this app will give you a good revision of flutter and dart basics. Concepts covered are:

* Showing Widgets on the screen.
* Gridview.builder
* Function writing
* If and else in dart
